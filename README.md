## 🌀 Purpose of the App

BakkesMod is a super handy tool for Rocket League, but the menus can feel messy and tough to dig through. This app is built to make all that easier by giving you a cleaner, simpler way to find what you need. It cuts down on extra clicking and gives better visual feedback when you’re choosing things like decals or presets. The idea is to help the players get around without feeling lost. It doesn’t change what BakkesMod does, it just makes using it way smoother.

-**Can you make article sections for the following: I want an article section for "What does Bakkes Mod look like?", "What is wrong with Bakkes Mod?", "How it could be better?", and "A better Bakkes Mod interface". I would also like a paragraph section inside the article under the header.**
