1) Can you make me a slick darker mode style website that I can treat as a blog? 
   It should have a script folder with a script js file inside, and a styles folder with a style css file. 
   Keep the information of the page as a place holder because I am going to change it.

2) Can you make article sections for the following: I want an article section for "What does Bakkes Mod look like?",  
   "What is wrong with Bakkes Mod?", "How it could be better?", and "A better Bakkes Mod interface".
    I would also like a paragraph section inside the article under the header.

3) Can you make my footer to where it is a tiny bit smaller and stick onto the bottom of the screen?

4) Make me a place to insert a pictures.

5) Make me a place to insert a youtube video, just like the pictures above.

6) In this section I want to mimic making a home screen. Inside all of one div,
 can you make me two larger buttons and then below those two I want two rows of 4 normal sized buttons.
