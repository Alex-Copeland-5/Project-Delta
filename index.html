            <h2>What is Bakkes Mod?</h2>
            <p>BakkesMod acts as a locally run mod for Rocket League that injects new functionality into the game
                client, allowing for features such as custom overlays, aim trainers, and live performance metrics. Since
                all data remains on the client side, these modifications never alter gameplay or affect online
                opponents. Despite its flexibility, the existing interface is cluttered and unintuitive, making simple
                visual changes, like editing car overlays unnecessarily complex.</p>
