            <h2>What is Bakkes Mod?</h2>
            <p>BakkesMod acts as a locally run mod for Rocket League that injects new functionality into the game
                client, allowing for features such as custom overlays, aim trainers, and live performance metrics. Since
                all data remains on the client side, these modifications never alter gameplay or affect online
                opponents. Despite its flexibility, the existing interface is cluttered and unintuitive, making simple
                visual changes, like editing car overlays unnecessarily complex.</p>

            <h2>What does Bakkes Mod look like?</h2>
            <p>Bakkes Mod is a popular modding tool for Rocket League, providing players with additional features and
                customization options. The BakkesMod menu pops up as a small, dark overlay window with several tabs running across the top. The layout is packed tightly with checkboxes, sliders, and small buttons, which
                makes the interface look cluttered and a bit overwhelming. Most sections are text-heavy and feel stacked
                together, giving the entire menu an older, utilitarian look rather than a clean, modern one. Here is a
                picture of the Bakkes Mod user interface. </p>

                <img src="images/bm-ui-1.png" alt="BakkesMod user interface screenshot"
                    style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            </figure>

            <p>Before touching anything else, the first fix should honestly be making the launch window bigger. Right
                now everything feels squeezed together, and even a simple size increase would make the UI way easier to
                use. Now look at how much better it is.</p>

                    style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            </figure>
            <p>This may not seem like a lot, but everything helps.</p>

            <h2>What is wrong with Bakkes Mod?</h2>
            <p>The current BakkesMod interface really shows its age, and it doesn’t match the cleaner, more intuitive
                design people expect from modern apps today. A lot of important features are spread out across awkward
                tabs, so you end up digging around just to find basic settings. It works, but it definitely feels like
                something built years ago that never got updated to match how people actually use it now.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest problem I’m focusing on is the Items tab, which is the feature most people use. This section
                lets you equip any Rocket League cosmetic locally. This is a big deal considering most cosmetics are
                luck-based
                or locked behind a paywall. But even though it’s great for designing and previewing car setups, the menu
                itself is messy and tough to navigate. Everything feels crammed together, and finding specific items
                takes way more effort than it should. When you’re trying to look through hundreds of decals, wheels,
                boosts, and goal explosions, the layout starts to feel overwhelming fast.</p>

            <p>Here is a video of me applying a custom design to my car.</p>
            <figure class="videos-style">
                <div class="video-wrapper">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxJeZW75eTM" title="Applying a custom design to my car"
                        style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen>
                    </iframe>
                </div>
                <p>As you can see there are hundreds of decals to put on my car, but I have no idea what they look like.
                    If you are picky like me, it could take you multiple attempts just to find a decal that you enjoy.
                    You obviously can't have a cool decal and everything else stock. Doing this for everything else
                    takes up way too much time.</p>

            <h2>How it could be better?</h2>
            <p>The two main issues with BakkesMod are its cramped, hard-to-use buttons and its lack of visual feedback.
                The current interface uses very small, tightly packed buttons that make navigating the menu harder than
                it should be. It’s easy to misclick or accidentally select the wrong item because everything feels
                squeezed together. This kind of layout might have worked years ago, but with how many features BakkesMod
                now has, the menu simply hasn’t kept up. A cleaner UI with larger, more spaced out buttons, ideally
                starting with a simple home page that shows all the main sections. This would make the entire mod feel much
                easier and more natural to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other major issue is the lack of visual previews in the Items tab. The built-in Rocket League garage
                already shows a preview when you hover over a decal or cosmetic, but it only works for items you
                personally own. BakkesMod gives access to every cosmetic in the game, but you can’t see what something
                looks like until you actually click on it. When you’re browsing through hundreds of decals, wheels,
                paints, and goal explosions, having to equip each item one by one becomes slow and frustrating. Adding
                hover-based previews would make the customization process faster, smoother, and much more user friendly.
